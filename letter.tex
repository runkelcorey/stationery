        \subsection{Dear Analytics Team:}
        \sectionsep
        I write to fill your Data Analyst opening.
        My skillset---equal parts data science and communication---will thrive in an analytics role that depends on working across teams to solve problems.
        This opportunity would help me narrow the gap between my work and its impact and join an early-stage company that's changing architecture (as someone with the appreciation, but not the talent, to work the creative side of architecture/urban design, I've been searching for a way to get involved).

        I have experience extracting, managing, analyzing, reporting, mapping, and visualizing program data from a variety of sources to support business and research priorities.
        At the American Road \& Transportation Builders Association, I scripted a data pipeline that input public GIS data to a SQLite database so that we could map the need for, and impact of, policies in Congressional districts.
        That role also saw me perform analyses used in Congressional testimony and interface with stakeholders inside and outside of the organization.
        The following school year, I built on this experience for my \href{https://runkelcorey.github.io/publication/thesis/outcome.html#outcome}{thesis} on the foreclosure crisis, which used R analyze housing data in 27,000 Census tracts.

        I now research at Yale University, where I write case studies that review worldwide responses to financial crises.
        After 15 cases, I have grown skilled at tailoring data visualizations and technical details for decisionmakers.
        Each case sees me dive into the institutional quirks that produced a program, understand how it was administered, and work with my supervisors to communicate those features as clearly as possible.
        But, we work in a growing lab with limited technical resources.
        My favorite work has been addressing requests from colleagues by building API clients to extract usage data from webpages, \href{https://github.com/runkelcorey/valet}{databases}, and \href{https://github.com/runkelcorey/ela}{PDFs}.
        Or, in another project, persuading colleagues to adopt data-management software, writing code to integrate it with our existing workflows, and responding to feedback with updates and clear documentation.
        These have taught me how to meet people where they are technically and how to approach the data needs of colleagues in different roles.

        I can manage data projects, understand the technical and data requirements for solving a particular problem, and communicate my work with senior leadership.
        I want to make a career leveraging data to support architecture/urban design, and this position fits that role perfectly.
